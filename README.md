# üè° House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict house prices using Linear Regression, based on structured housing data.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `HousePriceEDA.ipynb` ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook with EDA, data cleaning, model training & prediction
- `train.csv` ‚Äì Training dataset with features and target (SalePrice)
- `test.csv` ‚Äì Test dataset for prediction
- `submission.csv` ‚Äì Final model predictions
- `sample_submission.csv` ‚Äì Sample Kaggle submission format
- `data_description` ‚Äì Text description of dataset features

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Jupyter Notebook

## üîç Workflow

1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Handled missing values and categorical encoding
3. Trained a Linear Regression model
4. Generated predictions on the test set
5. Created `submission.csv` for final results

## ‚úÖ Output

Predictions are saved in `submission.csv` (based on `test.csv` input). The model predicts housing prices based on features such as area, location, number of rooms, and more.
